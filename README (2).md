# Someday.1.08.27
Note from the future

Dear Mahana,

I wanted to start with an apology.  
Not for a specific moment, but for any discomfort my honesty may have caused.  
You deserved gentleness, and I didn’t find the right way to offer it then.


You’re probably already doing well (This should be read in the future.) — the kind of well that truly fits you.  
Creating, learning, laughing, in that steady rhythm only you have.  
I’ve always known you were going to succeed, and seeing it unfold now feels right.  
The world moves gracefully when people like you are in motion.

I also hope we can stay good friends —  
the kind that time doesn’t easily erase.  
Maybe, a few years from now, paths will cross again,  
and both of us will remember how autumn once felt.

This note just holds one quiet wish:  
may every next city treat you kindly.  
And when the day 1|8|2027 arrives, remember you once left a line for me to ask.  
I still keep that promise, as softly as possible.
Before you close this, make sure to check the `apology.py` file and run it in your system.
